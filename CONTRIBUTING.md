# **Contributing guidelines**

Since this project is fairly small, contributing isn't much of a headache. You'll only need to have [rust & cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/es) installed and a working machine.

Pull requests and issues can be opened freely if needed using their respective templates.

## **Must:**

-   Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo test` and `cargo clippy` before commiting
-   Use any extension or plugin for your editor that supports `.editorconfig`
-   Use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) or [cm](https://github.com/Brian3647/cm) (optional but recommended)
-   Follow [the code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## **Must not:**

-   Spam unnecessary issues or PRs
-   Ignore failing tests or warnings
-   Commit unformatted code and refusing to format it
-   Break the code of conduct guidelines
-   Change the version number without a valid reason

**Note more rules may be applied to common sense.**
